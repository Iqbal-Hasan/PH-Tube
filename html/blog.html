        <h1 class="blog-title">Var, Let, and Const: What's the Difference?</h1>
        <img class="blog-img" src="../img/images.png" alt="" />
        <div class="point">
          <h5>Var</h5>
          <p>
            The var keyword is the oldest and most basic way to declare
            variables in JavaScript. Variables declared with var are
            function-scoped, which means that they are accessible within the
            function in which they are declared, and in any nested functions.
            var variables can be reassigned, and they can be declared without
            being initialized.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="point">
          <h5>Let</h5>
          <p>
            The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015). Variables
            declared with let are block-scoped, which means that they are
            accessible within the block in which they are declared. Blocks are
            defined by curly braces ({}). let variables can be reassigned, but
            they cannot be re-declared.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="point">
          <h5>Const</h5>
          <p>
            The const keyword was also introduced in ES6. Variables declared
            with const are constant, which means that they cannot be reassigned.
            const variables are also block-scoped.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="secodary-title">Which keyword should you use?</h2>
        <div class="point">
          <p class="margin-bottom">
            In general, you should use let for variables that you may need to
            reassign, and const for variables that you know will not change. You
            can use var if you need to support older browsers that do not
            support let or const.
          </p>
          <p class="margin-bottom">
            Here are some additional things to keep in mind when using var, let,
            and const:
          </p>
          <ul class="margin-bottom">
            <li>
              Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope,
              even if they are declared later in the code. This means that they
              can be accessed before they are declared, which can lead to
              errors. Variables declared with let and const are not hoisted.
            </li>
            <li>
              Variables declared with const must be initialized when they are
              declared. This means that you cannot declare a const variable and
              then initialize it later in the code.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="margin-bottom">
            I hope this article helps you understand the differences between
            var, let, and const in JavaScript.

        <img class="blog-img" src="../img/null.jpg" alt="" />
        <p class="margin-bottom">
          Null and undefined are two special values in JavaScript that represent
          the absence of a value. Null is used to represent the intentional
          absence of a value, while undefined is used to represent the
          unintentional absence of a value.
        </p>
        <div class="point">
          <h5>Undefined</h5>
          <p>
            Undefined is the default value for a variable that has not been
            assigned a value. It is also the value that is returned by the
            typeof operator when it is applied to an undefined variable.
          </p>
          <p class="margin-bottom">
            Here are some examples of how undefined is used in JavaScript:
          </p>
          <ul class="margin-bottom">
            <li>
              A variable that is declared but not assigned a value is undefined.
            </li>
            <li>
              The value returned by a function that does not return a value is
              undefined.
            </li>
            <li>
              The value of an object property that does not exist is undefined.

          <ul class="margin-bottom">
            <li>
              A variable can be assigned the value of null to indicate that it

            </li>
            <li>
              A function can return the value of null to indicate that it did
              not find the value that it was looking for.
            </li>
            <li>
              An object property can be set to the value of null to indicate
              that the property does not have a value.

        <h2 class="secodary-title">When to Use Null and Undefined</h2>
        <div class="point">
          <p class="margin-bottom">
            The following are some guidelines for when to use null and undefined
            in JavaScript:
          </p>
          <ul class="margin-bottom">
            <li>
              Use undefined to represent the unintentional absence of a value.
              For example, if a variable is declared but not assigned a value,
              it should be undefined.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use null to represent the intentional absence of a value. For
              example, if a function does not find the value that it is looking
              for, it can return the value of null.
            </li>
            <li>
              Avoid using null and undefined interchangeably. They have
              different meanings and should be used in different contexts.

        <h1 class="blog-title">What is a REST API?</h1>
        <img class="blog-img" src="../img/rest.png" alt="" />

        <div class="point">
          <p class="margin-bottom">
            A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming
            Interface) is an architectural style for designing web services. It
            defines a set of constraints that must be followed in order to be
            considered RESTful. These constraints include:
          </p>
          <ul class="margin-bottom">
            <li>
              Resource-oriented: The API must be organized around resources,
              which are nouns that represent things in the real world. For
              example, a REST API for a blog might have resources for posts,
              comments, and users.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stateless: The API must be stateless, which means that each
              request must be self-contained and should not rely on any previous
              requests. This makes the API more scalable and efficient.
            </li>
            <li>
              Client-server: The API must be client-server, which means that the
              client and server must be separate entities. This makes the API
              more flexible and secure.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cacheable: The API should be cacheable, which means that the
              client should be able to cache responses from the server. This can
              improve performance and reduce load on the server.
            </li>
            <li>
              Uniform interface: The API must use a uniform interface, which
              means that all requests and responses must use the same HTTP verbs
              and message formats. This makes the API easier to use and
              understand.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 class="secodary-title">Benefits of REST APIs</h2>

              choice for developers of all skill levels.
            </li>
            <li>
              Flexible and scalable: REST APIs are flexible and can be used to
              build a wide variety of applications. They are also scalable,
              which means that they can be easily adapted to handle increasing
              traffic.
            </li>
            <li>
              Efficient and reliable: REST APIs are efficient and reliable,

              performance.
            </li>
            <li>
              Secure: REST APIs can be made secure by using encryption and other
              security measures.
